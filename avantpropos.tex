Most of the work presented in this dissertation was published. 

First, the database of sky data is presented with its capture details and statistics. Then, the work of my colleagues and myself on modeling the sky and its impact on one-day PS is presented~\cite{holdgeoffroy-iccp-15}. Lastly, our work on the link between what happens in the sky and the reconstruction performance is presented~\cite{holdgeoffroy-3dv-15}, for which we received an award for ``Best Paper (Runner Up)'' at 3DV 2015.
