Most of the work presented in this dissertation was published between 2015 and 2018. Chapter~\ref{ch1} is mostly taken from our ICCP'15~\cite{holdgeoffroy-iccp-15} and 3DV'15~\cite{holdgeoffroy-3dv-15} publications. For the latter, we received the ``Best Paper (Runner Up)'' award in Lyon. More information on both works can be found at their project page, respectively \url{http://jflalonde.ca/projects/outdoorPS/} and \url{http://jflalonde.ca/projects/xHourPS/}. The work presented on chapter~\ref{ch2} has been submitted for peer review at ECCV'18; we are still awaiting updates for this submission. Chapters~\ref{ch3} and~\ref{ch4} were published to the prestigious CVPR (158 h-index), the former as a long oral presentation~\cite{holdgeoffroy-cvpr-17} (3\% acceptance rate), and the latter as a poster~\cite{holdgeoffroy-cvpr-18} (30\% acceptance rate). More information on both can be found on their project page, \url{http://jflalonde.ca/projects/deepOutdoorLight/} and \todo{add project page}.
