Most of the work presented in this dissertation was published between 2015 and 2018. Chapter~\ref{ch1} is mostly taken from our ICCP'15\cite{holdgeoffroy-iccp-15} and 3DV'15~\cite{holdgeoffroy-3dv-15} publications. For the latter, we received the ``Best Paper (Runner Up)'' award in Lyon. The work presented on chapter~\ref{ch2} has been submitted for peer review at ECCV'18; we are still awaiting updates for this submission. Chapters~\ref{ch3} and~\ref{ch4} were published to the prestigious CVPR (158 h-index), the former as a long oral presentation (3\% acceptance rate), and the latter as a poster (30\% acceptance rate).
